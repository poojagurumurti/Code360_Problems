# Problem statement
# Send feedback
# You have been given an array/list 'ARR' consisting of 'N' integers. Your task is to find the majority element in the array. If there is no majority element present, print -1.

# Note:
# A majority element is an element that occurs more than floor('N' / 2) times in the array.
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Constraints:
# 1 <= T <= 100
# 1 <= N <= 5 * 10^3
# -10^5 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5

# Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the element at the 'i'th index in the array/list 'ARR'.

# Time limit: 1 sec
# Sample Input 1:
# 2
# 5
# 2 3 9 2 2
# 4
# 8 5 1 9 
# Sample Output 1:
# 2
# -1
# Explanation of Sample Output 1:
# In test case 1, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

# 2 → 3 times
# 3 → 1 time
# 9 → 1 time

# As 2 occurs more than floor(5/2) (i.e. floor(2.5) = 2) times, it is the majority element.

# In test case 2, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

# 8 → 1 time
# 5 → 1 time
# 1 → 1 time
# 9 → 1 time

# As no element occurs more than floor(4/2) = 2 times. Thus No majority element is present.
# Sample Input 2:
# 2
# 7
# 8 8 8 8 8 9 1 
# 4
# 2 2 3 3
# Sample Output 2:
# 8
# -1
# Explanation of Sample Output 2:
# In test case 1, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

# 8 → 5 times
# 9 → 1 time
# 1 → 1 time

# As 8 occurs more than floor(7/2) (i.e. floor(3.5) = 3) times, it is the majority element.

# In test case 2, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

# 2 → 2 times
# 3 → 2 times

# As no element occurs more than floor(4/2) = 2 times. Thus No majority element is present.
