# Problem statement
# Send feedback
# You have been given a sorted array/list 'arr' consisting of ‘n’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘k’.
# Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you.
# For example, if 'arr' = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8], then after rotating 'arr' at index 3, the array will be 'arr' = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].
# Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘k’ is present in 'arr'.
# Note :
# 1. If ‘k’ is not present in 'arr', then print -1.
# 2. There are no duplicate elements present in 'arr'. 
# 3. 'arr' can be rotated only in the right direction.


# Example:
# Input: 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] , 'k' = 2

# Output: 3

# Explanation:
# If 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] and 'k' = 2, then the position at which 'k' is present in the array is 3 (0-indexed).


# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Sample Input 1:
# 4 3
# 8 9 4 5


# Sample output 1:
# -1 


# Explanation of Sample Output 1:
# For the test case, 3 is not present in the array. Hence the output will be -1.


# Sample Input 2:
# 4 3
# 2 3 5 8


# Sample output 2:
# 1


# Expected Time Complexity:
# Try to do this in O(log(n)). 


# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 <= k <= 10^9
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

# Time Limit: 1 second
